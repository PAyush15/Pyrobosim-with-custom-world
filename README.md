Consider the above image. The world is created solely using the pyrobosim. pyrobosim is primarily a world modeling framework for prototyping high-level robotics behavior applications.

To run the world environment for robot navigation, run the idac_world.py file at the location 'pyrobosim/pyrobosim/examples/' folder by navigation to that folder in the terminal and simply running the python script: python3 idac_world.py --multirobot

'--multirobot' argument launches the world with two robots which can be controlled independently.
